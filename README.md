# Person Class

## Overview
This project focuses on designing a `Person` class that encapsulates fundamental personal information. The class includes attributes such as first name, last name, identity document number, and year of birth. A constructor is used to initialize these values upon object creation.

## Features
- A structured `Person` class.
- Essential attributes:
  - `name` (string)
  - `surname` (string)
  - `idNumber` (string or numeric)
  - `birthYear` (integer)
- A constructor method for initializing these attributes.
